# Contributing to Java Coding Challenges

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to help students and developers learn Java through practical coding challenges.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

1. **🆕 New Problems**: Add interesting coding challenges
2. **💡 Improved Solutions**: Optimize existing code or provide alternative approaches
3. **🧪 Test Cases**: Add comprehensive test cases for problems
4. **📚 Documentation**: Improve explanations, comments, or README files
5. **🐛 Bug Fixes**: Report and fix any issues

### Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/java-coding-challenges.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Adding New Problems

When adding a new coding problem, please follow this structure:

```java
/**
 * Problem Title - Brief Description
 * Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard 🟢🟡🔴
 * Topic: Category (e.g., Arrays, OOP, Algorithms)
 */
public class YourProblem {
    // Your solution with detailed comments
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases and examples
    }
}
```

### Code Standards

- **Clean Code**: Use meaningful variable names and add comments
- **Documentation**: Include JavaDoc comments for methods
- **Testing**: Provide test cases in the main method
- **Performance**: Mention time and space complexity when relevant

### Pull Request Process

1. **Test** your code thoroughly
2. **Update** documentation if needed
3. **Commit** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Binary search implementation"
   ```
4. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Create** a Pull Request with:
   - Clear title and description
